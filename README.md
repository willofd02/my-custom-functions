# my-custom-functions

Use with My Custom Functions BY SPACE X-CHIMP Wordpress plugins. Copy & paste the code to Setting -> PHP Inserter, 
change OFF to ON then click save button.

I will not take any responsible if your wordpress or woocommerce site damage. By the way, if your website interupt, you can disable
the plugins by going to your server file manager (Cpanel) and go to wp-content -> plugins -> my-custom-functions, rename the START
file to STOP.

The website will be revert back and the plugins will be disabled (TURN OFF) in plugins configuration not wordpress plugin configurations.

Thank you!
